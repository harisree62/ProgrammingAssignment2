## aim is to writer two functions to inverse a matrix

## makeCacheMatrix is a function we are creating to store the inverse of the input matrix

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {

}


## Write a short comment describing this function

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
}
